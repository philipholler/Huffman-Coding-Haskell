# Huffman Coding in Haskell

This was done as a exercise in a functional programming class. 

It should be an easy to read and understand version of Huffman coding created in Haskell.

The code can be found in /app/Huffman.hs, but is also imported and available from /app/Main.hs

Feel free to use and share :-)
